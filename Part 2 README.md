# README for Coding Sequence Comparison Project

This project compares coding DNA sequences between Escherichia coli and Barnesiella intestinihominis. Analyses include counts and lengths of coding sequences, nucleotide and amino acid frequency profiling, codon usage bias assessment, and protein k-mer representation differences to reveal genomic and evolutionary distinctions.

## Included files

- ecoli_cds.fasta: Coding DNA sequences for Escherichia coli.
- barnesiella intestinihominis_cds.fasta: Coding DNA sequences for Barnesiella intestinihominis.
- Part 2.Rmd: R Markdown performing sequence comparisons, statistical analyses, and generating plots.
- Part 2 README.md: Documentation file explaining project purpose, included files, how to run the analysis, and contributors.

## How to run the code

1. Place input FASTA files (ecoli_cds.fasta and barnesiella intestinihominis_cds.fasta) in the working directory.
2. Open RStudio.
3. Run the R Markdown `Part 2.Rmd` line-by-line or as a whole to perform all calculations and generate output visualizations.
4. Review the printed summary tables and saved plot images for interpretation.
